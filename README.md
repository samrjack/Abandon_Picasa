Abandon Picasa project

This project is meant to allow users to upload all their photos and albums 
from picasa to google photos. I have not seen any other project or tools that
do this so I decided to make a quick one myself.

This project was inspired by a my grandmother who uses picasa religiously, but
recently (around mid May 2018) something changed so that picasa could not upload
its photos to google photos anymore and could not even email the photos without
exporting them manually. Because of this I wanted to switch my grandmother over
to google photos directly, but she has put so much effort into organizing her
photos into albums that I couldn't possibly do it manually. Therefore, I started
this projet to hopefully help her and anyone else that may need the assistance
(assuming it works in the end). It also seemed like a good oppritunity to practice
using REST APIs and just coding a project in general.
